As shown on page 5 of the textbook, special characters such as \$, \{, \~{}, and \%
are produced with a preceding backslash. Another way to produce these char-
acters is to use the \verb!\verb#stuff#!{} command, which typesets ``stuff'' verbatim
(including spaces and special characters) in a typewriter font. The beginning
and ending \verb\#\{} delimiters can be replaced with other non-letter characters such\\as \^{}, \textbackslash, 4, or !.

Only use \verb#\verb# to display short strings verbatim. Do not use \verb#\verb# to
change the font. For that purpose there is the command \verb#\texttt{text}# which
prints ``text'' in a typewriter font.

There are other commands which change the font: \textbf{bold},
