As shown on page 5 of the textbook, special characters such as \$, \{, \~{}, and \% are produced witha preceding backslash. Another way to produce these characters is to use the \verb!\verb#stuff#!{} command, which typesets "stuff verbatim (including spaces and special characters) in a typewriter font. The beginning and ending \verb\#\ delimiters can be replaced with other non-letter charaters such as \^{}, \textbackslash, 4, or !.
