\section{Instructions}

There are two exercises (which were typeset using the theorem environment).
% spacing between lines needs to be accounted for
\noindent\textbf{Exercise 1.} \emph{Recreate this entire document.}\footnote{How meta.}

\noindent\textbf{Exercise 2.} \emph{Create a new document containing a short description
of three of your favorite books, papers, or other publications. Be sure to include
a bibliog-raphy, created using \hologo{BibTeX}.}

An assignment which completes Exercise 2 in an interesting way or makes amusing
use of mathematical typesetting will earn the coveted \LaTeX er of the week distiction.

\subsection[Due Date]{When to turn it in}

Please upload the \verb~.tex~ and \verb~.bib~ source files and the \verb~.pdf~ output files
to your solutions to Assingment 3 on or before Sunday.

\section{Euler was excellent}

Euler proved many statements, such as
\begin{equation}
    \prod_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(1-q^m\right) = \sum_{n=\infty}^{\infty} \left(-1\right)^n q^{\left(3n^2-n\right)/2}. \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where q is an indeterminate. Equation \eqref{eq1} \index{pentagonal number theorem}is known as Euler's pentagonal number
theorem. Euler also proved theorem 1 below.
