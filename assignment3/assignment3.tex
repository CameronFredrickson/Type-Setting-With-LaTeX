\section{Instructions}
There are two exercises (which were typeset using the theorem environment).
% spacing between lines needs to be accounted for
\noindent\textbf{Exercise 1.} \emph{Recreate this entire document.}\textsuperscript{1}

\noindent\textbf{Exercise 2.} \emph{Create a new document containing a short description
of three of your favorite books, papers, or other publications. Be sure to include
a bibliog-raphy, created using \hologo{BibTeX}.}

An assignment which completes Exercise 2 in an interesting way or makes amusing
use of mathematical typesetting will earn the coveted \LaTeX er of the week distiction.
