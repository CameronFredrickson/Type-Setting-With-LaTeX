\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is a paper on a (relatively) new concept in deep learning called a capsule network. This is one of many ideas I may pursue as a summer research project. \cite{46351}
    \item This is also a paper on capsule networks. It is cool to see that people other than Hinton and his team at Google are playing around with this idea.\cite{2017arXiv171203480X}
    \item This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was one of the more enlightening books I have ever read. It covers many topics from counting, to elementary topology, and explains them in a very tangible way, especially when the author provides real world examples of the concepts he elaborates on in the book. \cite{strogatz2012joy}
