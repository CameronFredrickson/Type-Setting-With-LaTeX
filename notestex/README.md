NotesTeX
---
An All-In-One LaTeX Notes Package For Students.
---
NotesTeX is a modification of the original Jhep journal format in order to suit the needs of students in university. The NotesTeX package offers the following

* Several mathematics and physics packages.
* Margins and margin environments for tables, figures, and asides.
* \TeX\ shortcuts for various math scripts namely vector bold math, *mathbb*, *mathfrak*, and *mathcal*.
* *amsthm* integrations and special environments for theorems, lemmas, proofs, definitions, examples, and remarks.
* Stylized support for the *part* environment.
* A fullpage environment that spans across the text width and the margin for longer equations and horizontal figures.

The goal of this package was to make notetaking easier for students and offer easy support for marginnotes along with a reliable and legible formatting structure.
