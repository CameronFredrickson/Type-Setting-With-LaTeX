Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the position of Musical Bubble Engineer. I have over a decade
of experience with both rhythm and compostion on piano and drum set. I also
have a coding background in C and Python which has allowed me to gain competence
writing rigorous code, and thorough tests.

As every bubble engineer knows, linear algebra is the bread and butter of
bubble design and simulation. I will be taking my thrid course in linear
algebra this spring and intend to continue my pursuit to learn more about
operators long after the quarter's end.

I look forward to discussing the postion further with you in person. References are available upon request.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Cameron Fredrickson
